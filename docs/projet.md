# Research Project 

# 1. Description (2019 project)
Architects design and construct buildings. They combine science and art to make buildings and structures for their clients.
Sometimes they make new buildings and sometimes they redesign old ones.
They work as part of a larger team, just like yours. Structural, civil and environmental engineers make sure a project suits its
site. Construction workers like electricians, plumbers and carpenters, and project managers make sure the job
stays on time and within budget. Every role is important to get the job done.
Our cities and towns face big issues, like transportation, accessibility and even natural disasters. How can we
shape a better future for everyone? It will take teamwork and imagination. Are you ready to build a better tomorrow
together?

For the Innovation Project, your team will:

* Identify a problem with a building or public space in your community.
* Design a solution.
* Share your solution with others and then refine it.


# 2. Judging Session:

## The following outlines what you can expect in each of the judging sessions.
### Project Judging

Your team will spend fifteen (15) minutes with the judges. Your team will have five (5) minutes to deliver your
Project presentation to the judges â€“ this includes set-up time; the last ten (10) minutes are reserved for the
judges to ask questions. This presentation should be rehearsed and polished. The judges will wait until your
presentation is over to ask questions. Please stick to the five (5) minute time limit! Props and costumes are
permitted, and judges will look for creativity in the presentation style.
Remember, to be eligible for a FIRST LEGO League Project award, your team needed to identify a problem
relating to the theme, design an innovative solution to the problem you selected, and share your problem and
solution with others.
For questions about the Project, visit the Judging FAQ on the FIRST LEGO League website.
