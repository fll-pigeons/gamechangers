# Innovation Project 

# 1. Description (2020 RePlay project)


## Challenge Story:

All around us, there are opportunities to play and be active — from open parks to cement courts, in our classrooms, and even when we’re waiting in line. But more and more people are not active enough.

How and where can we help people be more active?
* How
  * Reward them!
  * Get them motivated
  * ...

* Where
  * The Park Bench
  * on the bus
  * ...

So how are we going to solve these challenges?
* ask people we know!


## For the Innovation Project, your team will:

* Identify a problem to solve.
* Design a solution to the problem for your community.
* Share your ideas, learn from others, and improve your solution.
* Pitch your solution at an event.


# 2. Judging Session:

Your team will spend ten (10) minutes with the judges. Your team will have five (5) minutes to deliver your
Project presentation to the judges; the last ten (5) minutes are reserved for the
judges to ask questions. This presentation should be rehearsed and polished. The judges will wait until your
presentation is over to ask questions. Please stick to the five (5) minute time limit! Props and costumes are
permitted, and judges will look for creativity in the presentation style.

Remember, to be eligible for a FIRST LEGO League Project award, your team needed to identify a problem
relating to the theme, design an innovative solution to the problem you selected, and share your problem and
solution with others.

For questions about the Project, visit the Judging FAQ on the FIRST LEGO League website.
