# Learning Plan

## 1. Basic Movement
 ### no sensors 
    * Drive straight
    * Turns; [Types of turn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1r6sVXjClU)
    * Navigate maze
    
 ### with sensor
    * Touch
      * Drive straight
      * Turns
      * Navigate maze    
    
    * Ultrasonic
      * Drive straight
      * Turns
      * Navigate maze

## 2. More Accurate Movement
    * Gyro
      * Drive straight

      * Turns
      * Navigate maze

    * Color
      * Simple Line following
        * Straight line
        * Turns
        * Navigate line maze

## Advanced   

* PID = Proportional-Integral-Derivative feedback control - more accurate travel or line following
    * [Control class - Class to interact with PID controller and settings.](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/motors.html) 
* Example using Micropython
