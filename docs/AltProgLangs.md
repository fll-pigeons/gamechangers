## Research on alternative EV3 programming languages (not completed)
#### [EV3 Software PC](https://www.lego.com/en-ca/themes/mindstorms/downloads)
#### [MicroPython](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software#MicroPython?fbclid=IwAR0go3PgzBw16JmvvLphNC_KR2sRoZfiBvkew6w2SBzcX4gZzSukVrIeM8I) - new Lego programming environment

* (MakeCode)[https://makecode.mindstorms.com/] - Microsoft MakeCode is an online programming platform that can control the EV3 and others.  MakeCode uses blocks (like Scratch) or JavaScript (text) programming.

[RobotC](http://www.robotc.net)
RobotC is a C-based programming language with a fully integrated software debugger that supports a range of different hardware platforms. 
Extensive documentation and online support is available. For more information, visit: /.

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
Scratch is a very popular visually programming environment. Several extensions have been created to support the NXT and EV3. 
For more information about Scratch, see:   Scratch 3.0 is in development and should be available in 2019 with continued support for EV3. Scratch can also be used with LEGO WeDo (see Scratch-ing the LEGO WeDo) and WeDo 2.0. For more about using Scratch with WeDo, see: https://scratch.mit.edu/wedo.

[EV3dev](http://www.ev3dev.org/) (like a dual boot from SD card that does not overwrite firmware on EV3)
EV3dev isn’t actually a programming language, but rather a Debian Linux-based operating system that can run almost all languages that any other linux distribution can run, including C++, Node.js, and Python. 
* [Python EV3DEV - version 2](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3devpython/) - uses Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the EV3 extension (uses EV3DEV code on SD Card without having to reflash firmware)
* ~~[EV3Python - version 1 - deprecated](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3python/)~~

* [EV3 BASIC](https://sites.google.com/site/ev3basic/) - Windows only
EV3 Basic is a textual programming language.
* [Ev3devSim](https://www.aposteriori.com.sg/Ev3devSim/index.html) - Browser-based Simulator for EV3DEV

[leJOS](http://www.lejos.org/ev3.php)
LeJOS (pronounced like the Spanish word “lejos” for “far”) is a tiny Java Virtual Machine that supports Java. 

[OpenRoberta](https://lab.open-roberta.org/)
Open Roberta is a free, drag and drop, cloud-based platform for programming LEGO EV3 and NXT robots. 

[CoderZ](https://gocoderz.com/)
CoderZ is a 3D simulated robot environment using virtual robots that are similar to the EV3 robot.
Programming can be done with either Blockly or Java programming languages. 
For CoderZ to work with LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 You will need to install [leJOS](http://www.lejos.org/ev3.php) on your EV3 Brick.

* [LabVIEW for LEGO MINDSTORMS ](https://www.ni.com/en-ca/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview-for-lego-mindstorms.html)
LabVIEW for LEGO MINDSTORMS (LVLM) and LabVIEW for Education (LV4E) are visual programming environments. 
The EV3 Software was built in LabVIEW, so LVLM provides a great next step for students who are familiar with that programming language and ready for something more powerful and versatile.
