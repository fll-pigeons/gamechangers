# Robot Design

## 1. Judging session:

In the Robot Design Judging area, your team will find a Practice Table with a Challenge Set. The team can use
the field for explanation and/or demonstration purposes. During this session, your team will spend fifteen (15)
minutes with the judges. The team is expected to present the Robot Design Executive Summary (as outlined
in the Robot Design Executive Summary document), which should last no longer than four (4) minutes, to allow
for the judges to ask your team questions.
You must bring your robot, its manipulators, and a diagram, printout or a laptop that shows your
programming to the robot design judges!
