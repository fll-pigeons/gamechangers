## Motors:

### Driving the Robot - Dual Motor Control ([DriveBase class](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html))
* Drive straight or turn in place - then stop
  * [settings(straight_speed, straight_acceleration, turn_rate, turn_acceleration)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.settings) (modifies next straight or turn command)
  * [straight(distance)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.straight)
  * [turn(angle)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.turn) in place, then stop   
    
* Drive straight or turn - forever (until a stop() or another drive() command, or until program ends)
  * [drive(drive_speed, turn_rate)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.drive)
  * How to call drive:
    * drive() then [wait(milliseconds)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/tools.html?highlight=wait#pybricks.tools.wait), then [stop()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.stop) 
    
    ```  
    robot.drive(300, 0) # drive at 300mm/sec, in straight line (because turn_rate=0)
    wait(1000) # wait one second
    robot.stop() # not required if program ends after wait command 
    ```  
    --->[try it out in Pybricks Gears](https://kendmaclean.github.io/gears_pybricks/public/)  (copy code and paste it under Python tab)
    
    * call drive() many times inside [while loop](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/examples/robot_educator_ultrasonic.html) using [distance()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.distance) or [angle()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.angle):
     
      ```
      robot.reset()
      # keep driving until either robot has travelled 100cm or turned 45degrees
      while robot.distance() < 1000 and robot.angle() < 180:
          robot.drive(300,30) # drive for 300mm/s, while turning left at 30deg/sec 
          wait(10) # wait for a short time or do something else
      robot.stop()
      ```
      --->[try it out in Pybricks Gears](https://kendmaclean.github.io/gears_pybricks/public/)  (copy code and paste it under Python tab)
    
  * [reset()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.reset) - distance is calculated from start of program, so reset() it before using distance in a while loop

    
----- 

### Single Motor/Attachment motor control ([Motor class](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#motors))
* control motors with built-in rotation sensors
* Action
  * [run(speed)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.run)
    * Runs the motor at a constant speed, no stopping.  If it is the only command, make sure you use a wait 
      command, otherwise the program will end before run command can execute:
      
     ```
     motorC.run(200)
     wait(500) # run the lift motor command for half a second
     motorC.stop()
     ```
     --->[try it out in Pybricks Gears](https://kendmaclean.github.io/gears_pybricks/public/)  (use Tow Truck robot)
    
  * [run_angle(speed, rotation_angle, then=Stop.HOLD, wait=True)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.run_angle)
    * rotates motor X degrees relative to its current angle.
  * [run_target(speed, target_angle, then=Stop.HOLD, wait=True)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.run_target) 
    * rotates motor X degrees until they reach the absolute angle you specify.       

* Stopping
  * [stop()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.stop) - glide to a stop
  * [brake()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.brake) - motor friction stop
  * [hold()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.hold) - stop motor rotation and actively hold

## Sensors

* [classColorSensor(port)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.ColorSensor)
  * [3-level line follower using color sensor](https://github.com/fll-pigeons/gamechangers/blob/master/programs/LP04a_lineFollowerBasic):
    
    ```
    line_sensor = ColorSensor(Port.S1)    

    while True:
       if line_sensor.reflection()  > 80: # white
           robot.drive(speed=75, turn_rate=-40)
       else: 
           if line_sensor.reflection()  < 15: # black
               robot.drive(speed=75, turn_rate=40)
           else: #straight
               robot.drive(speed=75, turn_rate=0)
    ```
    --->[try it out in Pybricks Gears](https://kendmaclean.github.io/gears_pybricks/public/) (use Single Sensor Line Robot; and select Line Following Challenges from Worlds, under the Simulator tab)

  * [Proportional line follower](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/examples/robot_educator_line.html)
     
    ```
    BLACK = 10
    WHITE = 95
    threshold = (BLACK + WHITE) / 2
    PROPORTIONAL_GAIN = 1.5
    while True:
        deviation = color_sensor_in1.reflection() - threshold
        angle_correction = PROPORTIONAL_GAIN * deviation
        robot.drive(drive_speed=100, turn_rate=angle_correction)
        wait(10)     
    ```
    --->[try it out in Pybricks Gears](https://kendmaclean.github.io/gears_pybricks/public/) (use Single Sensor Line Robot)   
   
  * [classGyroSensor(port, positive_direction=Direction.CLOCKWISE)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.GyroSensor)
    * How to drive straight using gyro.angle (angle_correction calculates angle to turn robot in opposite direction of angle error):
  
    ```
    gyro_sensor = GyroSensor(Port.S3)

    robot.reset() 
    gyro_sensor.reset_angle(0)
    PROPORTIONAL_GAIN = 1.1    
    while robot.distance() < 1000:
      angle_correction = -PROPORTIONAL_GAIN * gyro_sensor.angle()
      robot.drive(drive_speed=200, turn_rate=angle_correction) 
    robot.stop()
    ``` 
    --->[try it out in Pybricks Gears](https://kendmaclean.github.io/gears_pybricks/public/)  (use Single Sensor Line Robot; and select Gyro Challenges from Worlds under the Simulator tab)
    
    * [How to turn using gyro.angle](https://github.com/fll-pigeons/gamechangers/blob/master/programs/LP03b_squareGyroDriveLoop.py):
  
    ```
    gyro_sensor = GyroSensor(Port.S3)

    gyro_sensor.reset_angle(0)
    while gyro_sensor.angle() < 45:
      robot.drive(drive_speed=200, turn_rate=90)
    robot.stop()          
    ```
    --->[try it out in Pybricks Gears](https://kendmaclean.github.io/gears_pybricks/public/)  (copy code and paste in under Python tab)

    * [reset_angle(0)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.reset_angle) - reset gyro angle before using it as a test in a loop
  * Gyro must be plugged to EV3 before power up.  Make sure brick does not move on power up.  Never plug in gyro to an already powered up EV3 brick - it messes up the calibration.
