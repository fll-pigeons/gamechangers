## Motors:

### Driving the Robot - Dual Motor Control ([DriveBase class](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html))
* Drive straight, or turn in place, then stop
  * [settings(straight_speed, straight_acceleration, turn_rate, turn_acceleration)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.settings) (modifies next straight() command)
  * [straight(distance)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.straight)
  * [turn(angle)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.turn) in place, then stop   
    
* Drive straight, or turn, forever (until a stop() or another drive() command, or until program ends)
  * [drive(drive_speed, turn_rate)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.drive)
  * How to call drive:
    * drive() then [wait(milliseconds)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/tools.html?highlight=wait#pybricks.tools.wait), then [stop()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.stop) 
    ```  
        drive(300, 0) # drive for 30cm, in straight line (because turn_rate=0)
        wait(1000) # wait one second
        stop() # not required if program ends after wait command 
    ```
     * call drive() many times inside [while loop](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/examples/robot_educator_ultrasonic.html) using [distance()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.distance) or [angle()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.angle):
      ```
         reset()
         # keep driving until either robot has travelled 100cm or covered a 45degree angle
         while (distance() < 1000 or angle() < 45):
            drive(300,30) # drive for 30cm, while turning left at 30degree angle 
      ```
  * [reset()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/robotics.html#pybricks.robotics.DriveBase.reset) - distance is calculated from start of program, so reset() it before using distance in a while loop

# Single Motor/Attachment motor control ([Motor class](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#motors))
* control motors with built-in rotation sensors
* Action
  * [run(speed)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.run)
    * Runs the motor at a constant speed, no stopping
  * [run_angle(speed, rotation_angle, then=Stop.HOLD, wait=True)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.run_angle)
    * moves the wheels X degrees relative to their current angle.
  * [run_target(speed, target_angle, then=Stop.HOLD, wait=True)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.run_target) 
    * moves the wheels X degrees until they reach an absolute angle you specify.       

* Stopping
  * [stop()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.stop) - glide to a stop
  * [brake()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.brake) - motor friction stop
  * [hold()](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.hold) - stop motor rotation and actively hold

----- 

# Sensors

* Basic:
  * [classTouchSensor(port)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.TouchSensor)
  * [class UltrasonicSensor(port)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/nxtdevices.html#nxt-ultrasonic-sensor) (from [nxtdevices module](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/nxtdevices.html))
  * [classInfraredSensor(port)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.InfraredSensor)

* More accurate
  * [classColorSensor(port)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.ColorSensor)
    * 3-level line follower using color sensor
    '''
    line_sensor = ColorSensor(Port.S1)    
    
    while True:
       if line_sensor.reflection()  > 80: # white
           robot.drive(speed=75, turn_rate=-40)
       else: 
           if line_sensor.reflection()  < 15: # black
               robot.drive(speed=75, turn_rate=40)
           else: #straight
               robot.drive(speed=75, turn_rate=0)
    '''
  * [classGyroSensor(port, positive_direction=Direction.CLOCKWISE)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.GyroSensor)
    * How to turn using gyro.angle:
  '''
      gyro = GyroSensor(Port.S3)
      
      gyro.reset_angle(0)
      while abs(gyro.angle()) < 66:
        robot.drive(200 ,150)
  '''
    * [reset_angle(0)](https://pybricks.github.io/ev3-micropython/ev3devices.html#pybricks.ev3devices.Motor.reset_angle) - reset gyro angle before using it as a test in a loop
    * Gyro must be plugged to EV3 before power up.  Make sure brick does not move on power up.  Never plug in gyro to an already powered up EV3 brick - it messes up the calibration.
