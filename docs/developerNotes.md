### papers
* [Simulating Lego Mindstorms EV3 robots using Unity and Python](https://www.cs.ru.nl/bachelors-theses/2018/Leo_Cornelissen___4606566___Simulating_Lego_Mindstorms_EV3_robits_using_Unity_and_Python.pdf)

### EV3 C programming environment
* [c4ev3](https://c4ev3.github.io/) programming stock-firmware LEGO® Mindstorms® EV3 in C/C++. 

### Visual Editor Toolkits
* [Google Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) A JavaScript library for building visual programming editors.
  * can generate Javscript, Python code
  * Sample implementations
     * [blockpy](https://blog.ouseful.info/2016/02/18/blockpy-python-blockly-environment/)
     * [Microsoft's PXT](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt)
     
* [Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit (PXT)](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt), PXT is a framework for creating special-purpose programming experiences for beginners, especially focused on computer science education. 
   * [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly)-based code editor along with converter to the text format
   * [Monaco code](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) editor that powers [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode),
 
* [Droplet](https://github.com/PencilCode/droplet) The graphical programming editor that powers [Pencil Code](https://guide.pencilcode.net/home/) - 
  * teaches programming in Coffeescript

* [Snap](https://snap.berkeley.edu/) Viual Block Editor - no code generation
  * A Scratch-inspired graphical programming language, it's not a library but is instead a full app with an integrated execution environment.

* [Project BIPES - Integrating Blockly, Micropython, WebREPL, much more!](http://www.bipes.net.br/)
  * Browser-based Block Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems.
  * Server Micropython compilation server
  * should work with EV3 - needs testers
  * based on [Blopy](https://github.com/mnoriaki/Blopy)
  
## Arduino
* [ardublockly-micropython](https://github.com/immakermatty/ardublockly-micropython)
* [Arduino - SparkFun Inventor's Kit for RedBot](https://docs.idew.org/code-robotics/)

## Raspberry Pi
* [BluPants Robot](https://www.hackster.io/blupantsrobot/coding-with-lego-ev3-and-blupants-e70c3d) - compatible with RaspberryPi and Beaglebone

## VEX
* [VEXcode VR](https://vr.vex.com/) - free online blockly type code (or Python) with 3D simulation environment; no line following attachment
